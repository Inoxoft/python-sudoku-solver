# sudokuClass

This is a teaching tool written in Python, used to teach beginners how to do things like write minimization functions, depth-first search, and recursion (crazy things to teach beginners!).

There are many helper functions, I recommend instructors review the sudoku_answer.py file and allow students to work with sudoku_question.py.
